        <article style ="padding: 20px;"> Let's look at S&P 500 returns by month.  Sell in May and go away? Read on and find out. 
        The chart below shows the average return by month since 1928.  I often hear so called financial experts say to sell in May and go away.  
        I wanted to look at some data to see if this actually makes any sense.  It seems that May does have a negative return 
        overall, so there is something to this conventional wisdom.  September is much worse on average, so maybe we should avoid that month too.
        Maybe sell in April and then buy back in September or October.

        This chart shows the average return by quarter.  Although May is in 2Q, it is one of the better quarters due to April.

            The purpose of this chart is to see how good or bad it could be in a given month.  The standard deviation, shown by the bars, is pretty similar by month, but the
            minimum and maximum returns are not.  October is notorious for crashes, but September's minimum of around 30% is pretty scary!

            OK, I couldn't resist putting this chart together! I looked at the total return for each president over their term and then calculated
            the average for the Democrats and Republicans.  I have seen others show this as an average annual return, but I wanted to look at the total return.
            Those that had more than one term had more time to increse or decrease their returns.
